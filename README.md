# W3C Core Styles Updated 

The [W3C Core Styles][] are style sheets that W3C made in the late 1990s and probably last updated in the late 2002.

The Core Styles is/was meant to be used by link to one the 8 style sheets "Oldstyle", "Modernist", "Midnight", "Ultramarine", "Swiss", "Chocolate", "Traditional" or "Steely" in a HTML-file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<title>Document title</title>
<link href="https://www.w3.org/StyleSheets/Core/Modernist" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css">
<h1>Hello</h1>

<p>A <em>small</em> text sample.
```

A more modern use would be to locally style Markdown in editors like [BBEdit][], [iA Writer][] etc.

Given that the CSS and HTML spec has changed a bit since 2002 it might be worthwile to update the style sheets while at the same time follow what the [W3C Core Styles][] page states:

> - For technical or aesthetic reasons, the W3C Core Styles may change over time. However, the general look and feel of each style sheet will be preserved.
